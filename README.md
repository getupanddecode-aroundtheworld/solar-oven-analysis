ðŸŒž Solar oven efficiency comparison using data science - Sustainable cooking technology analysis - Selection guide
**ðŸŒž Data science analysis of sustainable cooking technology : solar ovens!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project analyzes the efficiency of different solar oven designs to help determine which type works best for various cooking needs.

## ðŸ”¬ Analysis

We compare three main solar oven types:
- **Box Ovens**: Best heat retention, ideal for slow cooking
- **Parabolic Ovens**: Highest temperatures, great for quick cooking  
- **Funnel Ovens**: Balanced performance, easiest to build

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

- Temperature simulation over 2-hour cooking sessions
- Statistical analysis of efficiency ratios
- Multiple visualizations comparing performance
- Sustainability impact assessment

## ðŸš€ Key Findings

The best solar oven **depends on your needs**:
- Budget â†’ Funnel ovens (easiest to build)
- Performance â†’ Parabolic ovens (highest temps)
- Convenience â†’ Box ovens (most reliable)

## ðŸŒ± Environmental Impact

- Zero CO2 emissions during cooking
- Reduces dependence on fossil fuels
- Built with recycled materials
- Perfect for off-grid communities

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
- NumPy for mathematical modeling

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Complete analysis available in the Jupyter notebook with:
- Temperature evolution curves
- Statistical distributions
- Efficiency correlations
- Cooking phase comparisons
